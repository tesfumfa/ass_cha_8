<h2> Description</h2>
<p> This is a application written in JavaScript, using Node.js, and Inquirer and Jest from npm to generate a work <br>team-profile HTML file (with added CSS) after answering a few questions from the command line.</p>
<h2>Task</h2>
<p> This challenge is to build a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees<br> on a software engineering team and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. Because <br>testing is key to making code maintainable, I’ll also write unit tests for each part of code and ensure that it passes all of them.<br>
 Because this application won’t be deployed, I’ll  provide a link to a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality and all of the tests passing. I’ll  submit a link to the video and add it to the README of my project.

</p>
<h2>User Story</h2>
<p>AS A manager<br/>
I WANT to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info<br/>
SO THAT I have quick access to their emails and GitHub profiles<br/>
 <h2>Acceptance Criteria</h2>
 <p> GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input<br/>
WHEN I am prompted for my team members and their information<br/>
THEN an HTML file is generated that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on user input<br/>
WHEN I click on an email address in the HTML<br/>
THEN my default email program opens and populates the TO field of the email with the address<br/>
WHEN I click on the GitHub username<br/>
THEN that GitHub profile opens in a new tab<br/>
WHEN I start the application<br/>
THEN I am prompted to enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number<br/>
WHEN I enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number<br/>
THEN I am presented with a menu with the option to add an engineer or an intern or to finish building my team<br/>
WHEN I select the engineer option<br/>
THEN I am prompted to enter the engineer’s name, ID, email, and GitHub username, and I am taken back to the menu<br/>
WHEN I select the intern option<br/>
THEN I am prompted to enter the intern’s name, ID, email, and school, and I am taken back to the menu<br/>
WHEN I decide to finish building my team<br/>
THEN I exit the application, and the HTML is generated</p>
