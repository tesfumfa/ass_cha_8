<h2> Description</h2>
<p> This is a application written in JavaScript, using Node.js, and Inquirer and Jest from npm to generate a work <br>team-profile HTML file (with added CSS) after answering a few questions from the command line.</p>
<h2>Task</h2>
<p> This challenge is to build a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees<br> on a software engineering team and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. Because <br>testing is key to making code maintainable, I’ll also write unit tests for each part of code and ensure that it <br>passes all of them.<br>
 Because this application won’t be deployed, I’ll  provide a link to a walkthrough video that <br>demonstrates its functionality and all of the tests passing. I’ll  submit a link to the video and add <br>it to the README of my project.
